Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said the I/O edition is the company’s best coding model yet.\nBut this new preview, called Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 Thinking, is even better than the I/O edition. The stable version Google plans to release publicly is “ready for enterprise-scale capabilities.”\nThe I/O edition, or gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, was first made available to developers and enterprises in May through Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 Thinking can be accessed via the same platforms.\nPerformance metrics\nThis new version of Gemini 2.5 Pro performs even better than the first release.\nGoogle said the new version of Gemini 2.5 Pro improved by 24 points in LMArena and by 35 points in WebDevArena, where it currently tops the leaderboard. The company’s benchmark tests showed that the model outscored competitors like\nOpenAI\n’s o3, o3-mini, and o4-mini,\nAnthropic\n’s Claude 4 Opus, Grok 3 Beta from\nxAI\nand\nDeepSeek\nR1.\n“We’ve also addressed feedback from our previous 2.5 Pro releases, improving its style and structure — it can be more creative with better-formatted responses,” Google said in the blog post.\nWhat enterprises can expect\nGoogle’s continuous improvement of Gemini 2.5 Pro might be confusing for many, but Google previously framed these as a response to community feedback. Pricing for the new version is $1.25 per million tokens without caching for inputs and $10 for the output price.\nWhen the very first version of Gemini 2.5 Pro launched in March, VentureBeat’s Matt Marshall called it “\nthe smartest model you’re not using\n.” Since then, Google has\nintegrated the model\ninto many of its new applications and services, including “Deep Think,” where Gemini considers multiple hypotheses before responding.\nThe release of Gemini 2.5 Pro, and its two upgraded versions, revived Google’s place in the large language model space after competitors like DeepSeek and OpenAI diverted the industry’s attention to their reasoning models.\nIn just a few hours of announcing the updated Gemini 2.5 Pro, developers have already begun playing around with it. While many found the update to live up to Google’s promise of being faster, the jury is still out if this latest Gemini 2.5 Pro does actually perform better.\nFirst hour with \"Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05\"\nPositives:\n– It's faster\n– It produces more output\n– It has a better macro play (multi file edits, better overview)\n– Output structure is better (readable)\n– It's more concise and LESS APOLOGETIC!!\nBefore: \"You are absolutely…\n— Patrick Bade (@nishffx)\nJune 5, 2025\nyou guys cooked, really enjoying the app builder.\nmade a game and tested it out, it was using imagen to build assets on the fly ? and it's up, hosted, easy to share.

VB Transform brings together the people building real enterprise AI strategy.\nLearn more\nSolidroad\n, an artificial intelligence startup that promises to solve one of customer service’s most persistent problems, has raised $6.5 million in seed funding to expand its platform that automatically trains customer service representatives and improves AI agents.\nThe Dublin-founded company, led by\nFirst Round Capital\nwith participation from\nY Combinator\n, addresses a fundamental challenge facing growing businesses: how to maintain high-quality customer experiences while controlling costs as conversation volumes explode past 10,000 interactions per month.\n“CX leaders scaling past 10,000 conversations a month are often stuck between two options: either they maintain quality and eat the cost, or cut costs and watch customer satisfaction suffer,” said Mark Hughes, co-founder and CEO of Solidroad, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. “None of the traditional solutions work.”\nThe funding round, which brings Solidroad’s total capital raised to $8 million, comes as companies increasingly struggle to balance customer experience quality with operational efficiency. Traditional approaches — offshore outsourcing, legacy quality assurance tools, or fully automated AI agents — often result in deteriorating customer satisfaction scores, according to Hughes.\nHow AI analyzes every customer conversation to create personalized training simulations\nSolidroad’s platform operates as what Hughes calls “an aggregation layer” that sits atop existing customer communication channels, analyzing every interaction between companies and their customers. Unlike AI solutions that attempt to replace human agents entirely, Solidroad focuses on making both human representatives and AI systems more effective.\nThe platform automatically reviews 100% of customer conversations across multiple channels, applying AI-powered quality assurance that traditionally required manual review of just 1-3% of interactions. More critically, it transforms these insights into actionable improvements through individualized training simulations for human agents and refinement recommendations for AI systems.\n“Traditional QA has always been manual and retrospective,” Hughes explained. “Someone reviews a handful of calls or emails, applies a rubric, and tells you how you did. We had to completely rethink that approach. It wasn’t enough to just score conversations with AI — we set out to make the insights actionable.”\nThe system generates personalized training scenarios based on actual conversation patterns and identified skill gaps, creating what Hughes describes as targeted coaching at scale without adding process overhead or additional staff.\nCrypto.com cuts response times by 18% while major brands see dramatic ramp improvements\nEarly customer results suggest the approach delivers measurable improvements.\nCrypto.com\n, the cryptocurrency exchange, used Solidroad to reduce average handling time by 18% while simultaneously improving customer satisfaction scores from 87% to 90% — a 3-percentage-point increase that represents significant improvement in the customer service industry.\nMarketing automation platform\nActiveCampaign\nreported saving the equivalent of a full year of manual coaching time, which the company reinvested into higher-leverage training initiatives and faster feedback mechanisms. Customer engagement platform\nPodium\ncut new hire ramp time in half by embedding Solidroad’s AI simulations into their onboarding process.\n“Across the board, Solidroad customers are seeing 90% or higher go-live CSAT scores, faster ramp times, and a huge reduction in manual QA work,” Hughes said, citing additional results from\nPartnerHero\n, which saw a 30% improvement in agent proficiency scores.\nThe platform currently analyzes hundreds of thousands of conversations monthly for more than 50 customers, with new companies signing up weekly, according to the company.\nTwo former Intercom employees saw customer service tools failing even at successful companies\nHughes and co-founder Patrick Finlay, who serves as chief technology officer, developed their understanding of customer experience challenges during their tenure at Intercom, the customer messaging platform where they first met and collaborated.\n“Patrick was building features; I was selling them,” Hughes recalled. “We saw firsthand how important customer experience is to growth, but also how frustrating it was to work with tools that didn’t actually help CX teams do their jobs better. Even great companies were stuck duct-taping together solutions that weren’t built for them.”\nThe duo represents a growing trend of second-time founders applying artificial intelligence to enterprise operational challenges. Hughes previously founded and sold Gradguide, a career guidance platform, while Finlay co-founded Y Combinator-backed no-code startup\nMonaru\n.\nWhy Solidroad chose human augmentation over the AI replacement trend sweeping customer service\nThe customer experience software market has exploded as companies recognize the revenue impact of customer satisfaction, but many existing solutions focus on either full automation or basic analytics rather than systematic improvement of human performance.\nTraditional quality assurance tools typically require significant manual oversight and provide retrospective insights rather than proactive training. Meanwhile, fully automated AI agents, while promising cost savings, often struggle with complex or emotionally nuanced customer interactions, sometimes delivering what Hughes characterizes as “hallucinations” rather than helpful responses.\n“Unlike other AI-powered CX solutions, we don’t handle conversations ourselves,” Hughes explained. “Most AI CX tools are trying to replace humans with AI agents. We help them improve.”\nThis positioning reflects a broader industry debate about the optimal balance between human agents and artificial intelligence in customer service operations.\nFirst Round Capital’s bet signals confidence in human-AI collaboration over full automation\nFirst Round Capital’s lead investment represents a significant validation of Solidroad’s approach. The venture firm previously led early rounds for companies including\nNotion\n,\nUber\n, and other category-defining platforms, suggesting confidence in Solidroad’s potential to reshape customer experience technology.\n“We’re excited to be working with First Round which was the first institutional investor in companies like Notion, Uber, and many more,” Hughes noted in the company’s announcement. “But more importantly, they’ve backed founders who know how to build.”\nThe funding will primarily support aggressive hiring, particularly in San Francisco where the company is establishing its primary hub. Solidroad plans to relocate its Ireland-based team to the Bay Area while expanding across engineering and go-to-market functions.\n“We’re currently focused on hiring engineering and go-to-market roles,” Hughes said. “We’re looking for people who want to be at the frontier of AI and customer experience.”\nEnterprise security measures address growing concerns about AI analyzing sensitive conversations\nAs Solidroad analyzes sensitive customer conversations, the company has implemented enterprise-grade security measures including\nSOC 2 Type 2\nand\nISO27001\ncompliance. Customer data remains isolated in secure workspaces with no cross-client sharing, addressing privacy concerns that have become increasingly important as companies adopt AI-powered tools.\n“Security and privacy are core to how we operate,” Hughes emphasized. “Each customer’s data lives in a secure, isolated workspace. Nothing is ever shared between clients.”\nWhat Solidroad’s success reveals about the future of workplace AI adoption\nSolidroad’s approach reflects broader trends in artificial intelligence adoption, where companies increasingly seek augmentation rather than replacement of human capabilities. Rather than pursuing full automation, the platform enables what Hughes describes as “the right balance of humans and AI.”\n“We believe AI should handle repetitive, transactional work, and humans should take care of complex, emotional, and nuanced interactions,” Hughes said. “Solidroad helps companies understand where that line is and then helps both sides of it improve.”\nThis philosophy aligns with emerging enterprise AI strategies that emphasize human-AI collaboration rather than wholesale replacement of workers.\nThe bigger picture: Why continuous improvement may matter more than perfect automation\nSolidroad’s rapid growth and substantial funding round illuminate a critical shift in how enterprises approach artificial intelligence — one that prioritizes systematic improvement over revolutionary replacement. While much of the AI discourse focuses on dramatic automation that eliminates human roles entirely, Solidroad’s success suggests that companies may find greater value in technologies that make their existing workforce measurably better.\nThe timing is particularly significant. As the initial excitement around fully autonomous AI agents encounters the messy realities of customer service—where empathy, context, and nuanced problem-solving remain distinctly human strengths — companies are discovering that the most valuable AI applications may be those that enhance rather than eliminate human capabilities.\nHughes’s vision of making “every customer interaction” a learning opportunity represents something more profound than process optimization. It suggests a future where artificial intelligence serves as a continuous feedback loop, constantly raising the baseline of human performance rather than replacing it. This approach could prove more sustainable and ultimately more transformative than the binary choice between human or AI that has dominated much enterprise technology discourse.\nIn an era where customer experience increasingly determines business success, the companies that figure out how to systematically improve rather than simply automate may discover they’ve built something far more valuable than a cost-cutting tool — they’ve created a competitive advantage that compounds over time.\nDaily insights on business use cases with VB Daily\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.
